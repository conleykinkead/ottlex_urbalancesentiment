16,"After discussion, the experience was great to hear the many ideas brought to the table. First and foremost was the idea of building up central downtown, making all suburbs and neighborhoods have safe bike, walk lines leading there and more trams or electric or solar powered streetcars to make transportation easier to downtown especially from keeneland, airport, to downtown. More incentive for schools to promote trades and not college. Accountability for landlords who lease to college students to have safety in place. Green space and community areas per capital in new neighborhoods, better trees and greenery instead of cheaper varieties. Safer bike running lanes. Resining empty office space for cheaper living if useful purposes.

17,"1. Trolley/street car/ trans rail car transportation from airport/ keeneland to downtown area. Decrease traffic during peak times of the year- Keeneland.
2.  Protected bike lanes and walking areas around Lexington - Richmond Rd, Versailles Rd, Nicholasville Rd, Harrodsburg road all leading to downtown.
3 Decrease downtown traffic during events- park and ride areas near I-75 downtown to decrease traffic downtown
4. Increase venues downtown- more restaurants and entertainment so people will want to spend the day downtown and not be just a destination for a specific spot.
5. Build more residency and rebuilt properties downtown. Allow for a significant range to allow all price ranges.Repurpose office lease spaces for residency instead.

18,"New schools should be built when neighborhoods are built. Have enough schools so they aren’t so overcrowded. Provide resources so underperforming schools can thrive.
Solve traffic congestion problems. Offer a tram/shuttle from downtown to the airport and Keeneland. Safer bike lanes.
Protect historic properties. Make landlords accountable—fine them for not maintaining buildings!! Limit how many houses can be sold to commercial owners to rent or used as air bnbs. Turn unused commercial space into

19,"I would like to see more public transportation, preferably solar powered transportation. The routes of Hamburg to downtown and airport/Keeneland to downtown should have trams running along them.

New neighborhoods should be required to follow rules of minimum number of trees, shared greenspace, sidewalks, and bike lanes!


Would love to see more community gardens and architecture nature scapes.

I would love to see improvements in recycling.

To revitalize downtown, repurpose empty office spaces to residential housing. Give incentives to landlords to renovate historic houses for residential use.

School curriculum should include several different options designed to create jobs in Kentucky.

20,"We need a solar powered street car/tram from the following two areas to downtown:
1.  Hamburg to downtown
2.  Keeneland/airport to downtown

New developments MUST include green-space & additional native tree canopy requirements—

We MUST increase tree canopy. ",Comp Plan Relevant,"Public Transportation,Environmental Sustainability & Resiliency,Urban Greenspaces,Trees,Government Services,Infill & Redevelopment,Connectivity"
21,"Our group prioritized environmental/transportation improvements that would open up corridors to downtown, thus benefiting businesses and quality of life for citizens. For example, an electric/solar tram from the airport/Keeneland would be ideal in the long term. A dedicated streetcar line would be hip, and would draw more clientele than just a traditional public transport bus. Next, anytime the city takes over property in residential areas (ie floodplain) the land should immediately become a community garden. New construction permits for neighborhoods should include mandatory green spaces, tree cover, bike paths, etc. More stable funding for recycling.

22,"1. In 20 years I would like to see Lexington as a thriving city with a vibrant urban core surrounded by the beautiful land that makes our region so unique and appealing.

2. More transportation options that travel to points of interest and airport. I would love to see a marketing campaign from Lextran to destigmatize the bus system and encourage ridership from more visitors and Lexingtonians. Getting crazy for a minute…I’m thinking a Keeneland party bus from downtown to the airport and track during the season. The bus can be decorated, there can be a dj on board, it could become a real part of our culture.

More affordable housing, more community and green space, less huge parking lots.

23,"Wonderful experience! Intimate setting with discussion on matters/concerns relevant to my family and our city. Lexington needs a solar powered trolley that connects and travels through all the major points of interest and the highways. New neighborhoods need to be designed as master planned communities to include schools, parks, bike lanes, fire station, libraries, and grocery stores. We need more cultural points of interest to keep our economy flowing and to draw more visitors to come stay for longer than a drive by visit. Safe designated bike lanes are a must. Downtown Main Street needs a major overhaul with lots of shops and restaurants that encourage locals, in particular families and young adults to walk around for pleasure.

I learned about “housing first” in helping cut down on homelessness and would like to see it implemented in Lexington I’m the next 5 years to add to revitalizing downtown Lexington.
